                <p>Firewall on Demand service provides potential users (educational and academic community) the option to protect their networking equipment against network attacks and threats.</p>

                <h5><strong>Use</strong></h5>
            <div class="well">
                <p>The service enables users to mitigate active attacks aimed at their network equipment. 
                It is based on the creation of dynamic firewall filters that are applied to the network using the management protocol NETCONF and are propagated to compatible (Juniper) backbone network devices via BGP flowspec NLRI.
                In order to properly complete the application for a new filter is essential that the destination address belongs to the user's administrative network. Currently attacks are limited per /29 subnet.
                Requests for new filters are applied directly to the network and therefore users should pay extra attention in their request. Filters that have been applied to the network are removed after their expiry date, and users can activate then again by selecting the corresponding option. 
                Moreover, users are given the option for early deactivation of their requests.</p>

            <div class="well">
                <p>For security reasons, the submission of requests is monitored by the administrators of the service.
                The service administrators may at any time remove active requests from the network, if this is deemed necessary</p>
